	community in the past. New protocols and algorithms were validated
	via simulations by network simulators such as ns2 or GloMoSim. However,
	even with the increasing number of published simulation papers, contradictory
	results are decreasing the confidence in simulations today. First
	experimental results show that simulation models for Ad Hoc networks
	are far from being realistic and protocols developed in simulations
	failed in real word environments. As a result, the demand for experimental
	results and application deployments within the research community
	increases. In this paper, we introduce FRED as a suitable application
	to conduct protocol evaluations as well as user acceptance surveys.
	FRED (Flexible Radio Enabled Dialog) is an enhanced TED-System that
	allows asynchronous surveys or quizzes with a multi hop radio network,
	where individual participants conduct the survey independent of others.
	FRED is based on the pacemate sensor network platform that provides
	a comfortable lightweight housing, a simple radio interface and an
	intuitive GUI that allows long term evaluations of user acceptance
	and network protocols.},

	as well as between vehicles and roadside infrastructures. Currently
	available software tools for VANET research still lack the ability
	to asses the usability of vehicular applications. In this article,
	we present Traffic Control Interface (TraCI) a technique for interlinking
	road traffic and network simulators. It permits us to control the
	behavior of vehicles during simulation runtime, and consequently
	to better understand the influence of VANET applications on traffic
	patterns. In contrast to the existing approaches, i.e., generating
	mobility traces that are fed to a network simulator as static input
	files, the online coupling allows the adaptation of drivers' behavior
	during simulation runtime. This technique is not limited to a special
	traffic simulator or to a special network simulator. We introduce
	a general framework for controlling the mobility which is adaptable
	towards other research areas. We describe the basic concept, design
	decisions and the message format of this open-source architecture.
	Additionally, we provide implementations for non-commercial traffic
	and network simulators, i.e., SUMO and ns2 respectively. This coupling
	enables for the first time systematic evaluations of VANET applications
	in realistic settings.},

	interface and communicate directly with each other and the road traffic
	infrastructure are a promising field for ad-hoc network technology.
	Vehicular applications reach from entertainment to traffic information
	systems, including safety aspects where warning messages can inform
	drivers about dangerous situations in advance. As performance tests
	of the real system are very expensive and not comprehensive, today's
	evaluations are based on analysis and simulation via traffic simulators.
	In order to investigate the impact of traffic information systems
	there are two options: First, traffic simulators can be extended
	by application code and a simplified model for wireless communication.
	Second, existing network simulators can be coupled with existing
	traffic simulators. We favour the second approach in this work as
	we believe that the wireless communication characteristics influence
	the data transfer significantly and an oversimplified transmission
	model can lead to flawed results. In this paper we describe the feedback
	loop built by the Traffic Control Interface (TraCI) to outline its
	versatility. We explain its use to determine possible energy consumption
	reduction when traffic lights send their phase schedules to vehicles.},

sensor networks or vehicular ad-hoc networks. Recently, we have
developed and designed a general purpose data dissemination protocol
called AutoCast in this field that we evaluated in detail by
simulations. When we started to use AutoCast in real applications, we
found out that the description of AutoCast is incomplete, as we provided
the algorithms of AutoCast in details but did neither provide nor
describe a suitable Application Programming Interface (API) and AutoCast
was closely coupled to the application. The focus of this article is
twofold. First, we propose an appropriate API to encapsulate data
dissemination protocols like AutoCast and we specify the service
interface of AutoCast in detail. This API can serve as a reference model
for other nature and biologically inspired data dissemination approaches
and applications. Second, we evaluate two applications based on our API
with AutoCast in the field of wireless sensor networks and vehicular
ad-hoc networks to illustrate the usage of the API and demonstrate the
flexibility of this approach.",

	abstract={Experimentally driven research for wireless sensor networks is invaluable to provide benchmarking and comparison of new ideas. An increasingly common tool in support of this is a testbed composed of real hardware devices which increases the realism of evaluation. However, due to hardware costs the size and heterogeneity of these testbeds is usually limited. In addition, a testbed typically has a relatively static configuration in terms of its network topology and its software support infrastructure, which limits the utility of that testbed to specific casestudies. We propose a novel approach that can be used to (i) interconnect a large number of small testbeds to provide a federated testbed of very large size, (ii) support the interconnection of heterogeneous hardware into a single testbed, and (iii) virtualise the physical testbed topology and thus minimise the need to relocate devices. We present the most important design issues of our approach and evaluate its performance. Our results indicate that testbed virtualisation can be achieved with high effciency and without hindering the realism of experiments.},

	devices (e.g., sensor nodes) offering different services are integrated

	often characterized by ad-hoc communication links, decentralized
	service discovery and self-description is needed. Due to the existence
	of different protocols, a protocol conversion to integrate WSNs into
	today's (IP-based) networks is essential. We propose an approach
	to efficiently realize self-description and dynamic discovery of
	embedded Web Services using a schema-based WSDL compression. Furthermore,
	we present an approach to convert between standard Web Service transport
	bindings such as SOAP+HTTP and optimized binding for WSNs using schema-based

  abstract = {Today's Internet is approaching architectural limits that are set up by its legacy architecture. It is based on technologies and algorithms that were developed about 30 years ago. Thus intensive research is done in the field of new protocols and algorithms fulfilling the needs of the Future Internet. We believe that wireless sensor networks (WSNs), sensor-equipped devices such as cellphones and other embedded systems will have a vital part in this context, providing a way to obtain information about the real world. All of these new devices will produce a huge amount of data by sensing and interacting with their environment. At present, complex low-level sensor node programming and algorithm knowledge is necessary to access sensor data, and only a few mature techniques exist to integrate heterogeneous WSNs with the Internet. The goal of Real-World G-Lab, which is part of the German-Lab (G-Lab) project, is to overcome these obstacles by working on the different levels of protocols, services and applications. We will enable developers to write applications that rely on sensor data input, without knowledge of the underlying hardware platform and the network communication algorithms. This implies that sensors are able to participate in the Future Internet as peer hosts. This enables new fields of applications but likewise opens a set of new challenges in the context of efficient request processing by WSNs. Efficiency here means the optimization of query-latency, energy efficiency and general service-guarantees regarding the access to sensor nodes. Beyond this we need the ability to scale to a large amount of requests from the Internet while maintaining low latencies. We will verify our concepts and applications inside the controllable environment of the G-LAB research network, by adding several outdoor WSN deployments to the experimental facility of the G-LAB project. In summary, Real-World G-LAB will contribute to the integration of resource-constrained (wireless) sensor devices into the Future Internet by investigating several key challenges, ranging from low-level energy efficiency to improved high-level application development.},

	until today, no widespread deployment of such IoT applications can
	be observed. Major challenges to master issues of embedded programming,
	massive distribution, resource constraints, heterogeneity, and seamless

	such a number of different devices to form an application can be
	arbitrarily complex. In the Internet and especially in Enterprise
	IT, the concept of Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA) has been
	applied successfully to address this orchestration problem. However,
	the technologies used to realize SOAs (such as Web Services, HTTP,
	XML, or BPEL) are to heavyweight to be used in resource-constraint

It is based on the well-established model of using signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR), which is very accurate and allows for highly realistic predictions of collisions. However, traditional implementations require O(n) time to compute interference values. We evaluate how to speed this up by using effcient data structures such as k-d-trees or geometric hash tables in our implementation. There are different levels of accuracy, some of which allow for O( p n + a) lookups, where a is the number of nearby senders. We demonstrate the achievable speedup and discuss accuracy tradeoffs for different settings using the Shawn simulator.},

@inproceedings{bimschas2010smartgateways,
	abstract={There is an increasing trend to integrate sensor networks into the Internet, eventually resulting in an Internet of Things. Recent efforts of porting IPv6 to sensor networks turn sensor nodes into equitable Internet peers and RESTful Web Services on sensor nodes allow a distribution of the application logic among sensor nodes and more powerful Internet nodes. The touching point between a sensor network and the Internet is the gateway which translates between the link-layer protocols used in the Internet (Ethernet, Wi-Fi) and sensor networks (IEEE 802.15.4). So far, the functionality of those gateways was fixed and simple. We propose to turn these gateways into smart gateways by enabling them to execute application code. As only the gateway has full knowledge of and control over both the sensor network and the Internet, smart gateways can act as performance-enhancing proxies and intelligent caches to preserve the limited resources of the sensor network. Also, the smart gateway can perform application-specific protocol conversion between highly optimized but non-standard protocols in the sensor network and standardized, but less efficient protocols in the Internet. In this paper we present the design of a middleware for smart gateways that allows the execution of application code on the gateway by offering simplified interfaces to the sensor network and the Internet. We also report preliminary performance results for key functions of the middleware.},

Current traffic monitoring and management approaches with stationary infrastructure lack flexibility with respect to system deployment and have difficulties with detecting unpredictable events (e.g., accidents). One goal of AutoNomos is the development of a distributed and selforganising traffic information and management system without a centralised infrastructure. Our system relies on a GPS-based navigation system and a wireless radio interface; vehicles can gather information about the current position on the road network and form a vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) to share information about traffic phenomena. In this article, we introduce Hovering Data Clouds (HDCs) as a tool to collect, aggregate and disseminate application-specific data. HDCs evolve in a self-organising manner at locations of relevant data in the system. Although their data is hosted on the nodes, HDCs exist independent of the individual carriers. While HDCs float between physical carriers, their corresponding HDC messages are disseminated in the network by a new effective transport protocol named AutoCast, designed according to Organic Computing paradigms. Finally, we demonstrate that HDCs detect traffic phenomena reliably and propagate them robustly within the network.",

	abstract={The developed world is awash with sensors. However, they are typically locked into unimodal closed systems. To unleash their full potential, access to sensors should be opened such that their data and services can be integrated with data and services available in other information systems, facilitating novel applications and services that are based on the state of the real world. We describe our vision and architecture of a Semantic Web of Things: a service infrastructure that makes the deployment and use of semantic applications involving Internet-connected sensors almost as easy as building, searching, and reading a web page today.},
